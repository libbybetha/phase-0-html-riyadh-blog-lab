        <p> Once a mudbrick waystation along desert <br>
         trading routes, Riyadh is now one of the wealthiest <br>
         cities in the world. The country’s political, financial<br>
          and administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>Riyadh (/rɨˈjɑːd/; Arabic: الرياض‎ <br>
            ar-Riyāḍ pronounced [arːiˈjɑːdˤ],"The Gardens")<br>
            is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia.<br>

              plateau, and is home to 5,254,560 people, and the urban<br>
